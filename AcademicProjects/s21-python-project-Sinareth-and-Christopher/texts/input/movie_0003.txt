The Martyred Presidents
The film, just over a minute long, is composed of two shots. In the first, a
girl sits at the base of an altar or tomb, her face hidden from the camera. At
the center of the altar, a viewing portal displays the portraits of three U.S.
Presidents—Abraham Lincoln, James A. Garfield, and William McKinley—each
victims of assassination. In the second shot, which runs just over eight
seconds long, an assassin kneels feet of Lady Justice.
